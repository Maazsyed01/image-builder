# Image Builder

Build image boxes for develop, testing and deploy.

Build without packer and virtual machine, docker only.

All config are generated by **gomplate**.


## Supported Distribution

* Debian


## Build

```shell
make debian:build
make debian:artifacts
```


## Q&A

* Why can't build in Docker or DIND (Docker in Docker)?  
  You need run docker as privileged mode 
  and enable **nbd** kernel module on your host `modprobe nbd`.


## TODO
Use systemd-container to replace chroot.
