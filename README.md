# Cloud Image Builder

Build image boxes for develop, testing and deploy.

All config are generated by `gomplate`.

## Supported Distribution

* Debian

## Build

```shell
make debian:generate
make debian:build
make debian:artifacts
```

## Q&A

* Why can't build in Docker or DIND (Docker in Docker)?  
  You need run docker as privileged mode 
  and enable **nbd** kernel module on your host `modprobe nbd`.


## TODO
使用 systemd-container 代替 chroot.
